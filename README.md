# DH&MM — Medieval Museum (Rooms 18–19) — Project Skeleton

This repository is a clean starting point for your course project.

## Structure
- `index.html` — main site with sections (Context, Audience, Star Assets, Project, Design Brief, UX Scenario, Team, Bibliography)
- `assets/css/style.css` — minimal styling
- `assets/js/main.js` — small JS helpers
- `twine/story-placeholder.html` — iframe target; replace with your Twine export
- `twine/story.twee` — optional Twee starter (compile with Tweego or Entweedle)
- `docs/DESIGN-BRIEF-template.pdf` — drop-in template (replace with your version)
- `docs/Design-Brief—draft.md` — Markdown draft aligned with template

## Quick Start
1. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click).
2. Edit the content sections (look for `TODO`).
3. Build your Twine story and export to HTML; replace `twine/story-placeholder.html`.
4. Fill the Design Brief in `docs/Design-Brief—draft.md` and finalize as PDF.

## Notes
- Keep images in `assets/img/` and credit sources properly.
- For deployment, use GitHub Pages (root branch) or any static host.
